    <h1>PORTFOLIO OUTPUT No. 5</h1>
1. Is there a 'center' or a central theme in your timeline and life? If you will give a title for your time- line what would it be and why?
<br>
<br>
Yes. The central theme about my timeline and life involves discovering talents that I never knew I had within me and using these to my advantage. If I were to give a title for my timeline, it would be called "Discovery, Victory". Similar to my previous statement about discovering new talents, my life was also plagued with mo-ments of uncertainty. During these finest hours, I found the light, one of hope, that led me back on track. Doing so made me victorious, as I had triumphed over my obstacles, time and time again.
<br>
<br>
2. Identify the turning points in your timeline. What were the thoughts, feelings and actions that you experienced?
<br>
<br>
When I first started school, I felt scared at first, but eventually, I learned how to adapt
<br>
<br>
When I first stepped foot as a Grade 1 student, I also felt scared, but as usual, I coped.
<br>
<br>
When I first got into a regional contest, I felt extremely happy of what I was able to ac complish.
<br>
<br>
When I first entered high school, I felt excited, which is contrary to what I had felt before in my preschool and my elementary years.
<br>
<br>
When I won a national con- test all by myself, it was one of the happiest days of my life.
<br>
<br>
When I struggled in making decisions on what school to go to for senior high, it was the lowest point in my life. However, through the help of family and friends, I was able to make it through.
<br>
<br>
3. Who are/were the most significant people in your life? How did they influence you?
<br>
<br>
Of course, my family remains as the strongest influence in my life, though friends also have made impacts on it. Many of the big decisions that I made in my life, like choosing to go away for school but eventually coming back, were also based on my family and friends' advice, and also of my personal reflection. They also helped me in my times of trouble, offering a shoulder to lean on, and were always there in my moments of glory and victory, celebrating the joy with me.
<br>
<br>
4. What would you change or add, if you could? How would each of these changes or additions affect your life, or even change its present course?
<br>
<br>
-To be honest, I am completely content with my life. It may be far from being perfect, but no one leads a perfect journey. I would not change anything in the past, as it would com pletely alter who, what, and where I am today. A tiny little change in one's past would have a sweeping effect on his or her present. I am happy, and even though I may be in a better situation if I had not committed mistakes in the past, I am willing to live with the fact and learn from them, carrying on with my life to- wards the future.
<br>
<br>
5. Where do you want to be in a year, 5 years, and 10 years? What do you expect your future time- line will be?
<br>
<br>
-In a year: I want to continue my studies and still get high grades. I also wish to keep on wining more contests and competitions, developing my talents and skills in prepara- tion for the future.
<br>
<br>
In 5 years: I see myself in col- lege in Manila. Hopefully, by this time, I have already found a course that I will stick to. I also wish that I will get good grades and still be a star stu-dent.
<br>
<br>
In 10 years: Hopefully, I al
<br>
<br>
ready have a job by then. I hope this job is one that I love, and also pays well. At this time, I would probably be thinking of starting my own

family.
